## CI / Validation

Every pull request that touches `data/orgs.json` runs two checks automatically:

1. **JSON syntax** — `python -m json.tool` catches malformed JSON immediately.
2. **Schema validation** — `.github/scripts/validate_orgs.py` verifies:
   - All required fields are present.
   - No duplicate IDs.
   - `type` is one of the four valid values.
   - At least one of `website` or `github` is present.

The deploy to GitHub Pages only runs on merge to `main`, after both checks pass.

---

## Running locally

No build step required. Serve the project root with any static file server:

```bash
# Python
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Node
npx serve .
```

Then open **http://localhost:8000** in your browser.

> Opening `index.html` directly as a `file://` URL will not work because the app
> uses `fetch` to load `data/orgs.json`, which browsers block on `file://`.
